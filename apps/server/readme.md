2. Install your dependencies

    ```
    cd path/to/server
    npm install
    ```

## Scaffolding

This app comes with a powerful command line interface for Feathers. Here are a few things it can do:

```
$ npx feathers help                           # Show all commands
$ npx feathers generate service               # Generate a new Service
```
