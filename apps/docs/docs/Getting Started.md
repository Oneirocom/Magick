# Getting Started

## Setup and Installation

There are currently two ways to use Magick: on the cloud through our waitlist (https://magickml.com), and by running the code locally on your own computer.

## Cloud - (currently in invite-only alpha testing) 

ðŸ“œ At this current stage of development, our Cloud experience is limited to those who have received an invitation to explore and build in Magick. You can join our waitlist [here](https://www.magickml.com). 

When it is your turn to build in Magick, you'll receive a special message from our team...so keep an eye open for that...

ðŸ’¬ You are also welcome and encouraged to connect with other Magick Makers in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/magickml)!


## Open Source repo

You can also build in Magick with our open source repo. Refer to the Magick [README](https://github.com/Oneirocom/Magick/blob/development/README.md) for the latest steps on installing and how to clone the repo and run from source.

Development is straightforward. You will need git and node.js 18+ installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/Oneirocom/Magick
cd Magick
npm install
npm run dev
```

Installation is automatic. You may need to type in your password for sudo to install some dependencies.

Build will take some time initially. When everything is ready, the client will be ready at localhost:4200 and docs at localhost:3001
