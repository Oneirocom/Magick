# Generate Text

Takes a string input and generates an AI text completion which is output as a string. The Model Name property lets you select between the various text completion models that have been integrated into Magick. Changing the model name will provide relevant properties for the model such as Temperature and Top P (explanations of which can be found online). The GPT 3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 models have optional System Directive and Conversation properties. The System Directive is a string that describes how the chat completion model should behave and the Conversations property allows you to pass in an array of previous chat messages for the model to use as short-term memory. The conversation array can be generated by using the Events to Conversation node.
