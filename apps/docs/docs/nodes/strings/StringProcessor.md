# String Processor

The String Processor component takes a string as an input and allows you to write a function in the text editor to parse that string in whatever way you need.  You can define any number of outputs which you can pass the result of your parsing out through.

Note that the return value of your function must be an object whose keys match the names of your generated output sockets.
