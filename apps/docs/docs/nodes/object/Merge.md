# Merge Objects

Takes any number of variable inputs and composes a single output object using the input names as the property keys and the values passed into them. An optional object input can be passed in, which will add any properties and values from that object to the output but overwrite its values with any of the named socket inputs values with matching property names. For example if you pass in an object {"prop1": "val1", "prop2": "val2"}, then create a socket named "prop2" and pass in a value of "overwritten", and another named socket named "prop3" and pass in a value of "val3", your output object will look like {"prop1": "val1", "prop2": "overwritten", "prop3": "val3"}.
