# Request

Allows you to make HTTP web requests to a server specified in the URL property. The Headers property accepts a JSON formatted object of key-value paired headers. The Method property is the HTTP method to be used (such as GET or POST). The body inputs allow you to pass any number of inputs which will be sent as query parameters for GET/PUT requests and as a formatted key/value body for all other request methods.
