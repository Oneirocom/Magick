# Connectors

Magick offers a growing list of connectors to external services, software, and other endpoints. A connector can be anything from a live Twitter webhook that catches tweets with a specific hashtag to a home automation system or Alexa integration.

Connectors typically have specific inputs and outputs. The default output will return a response to the original connector input unless otherwise specified or overridden.
