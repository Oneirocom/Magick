# Loop Connector

The loop connector allows the agent to run continuously at a fixed interval. This allows the agent to perform regular tasks, check on updates or actively engage users using other connector outputs

# Usage

Once you've enabled the loop, set a non-negative value for time, in seconds. We recommend not setting the timer to less than one second.
