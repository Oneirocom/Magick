# Magick Twitter Connector

Magick supports running agents on twitter. Currently only feed is supported, although DMs will b e supported in the v0.2.0 release.

# Usage

Twitter can be enabled on any agent. Each agent will need separate API credentials.

Stream Rules - Twitter uses stream rules to filter streams. You can find more info here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/filtered-stream/integrate/build-a-rule
If you're not sure where to start, try "#wizardmemes" - hashtags are a standard part of Twitter's stream filtering system.
