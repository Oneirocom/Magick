# Package Overview

## Apps
### Client
@magickml/client (./apps/client)
Frontend application. Everything the user sees in Magick IDE is exposed through the client, although most of the code lives in client-core and editor packages, as well as engine. Thin, mostly contains build settings and Capacitor configuration (for binary builds).

### Server
@magickml/server (./apps/server)
Backend server application. Depends on server-core and engine. Thin, mostly contains startup code and configuration for the server. Provides an API which the client talks to, and runs preview spells for clients.

### Agent
@magickml/agent (./apps/agent)
Backend agent application. Depends on server-core and engine. Thin, startups the AgentManager and manages agents from the database. Talks directly to the database, not to the server.

### Docs
@magickml/docs (./apps/docs)
Documentation server build on Docusaurus.
