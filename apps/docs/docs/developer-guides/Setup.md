# Setup

Refer to the Magick [README](https://github.com/Oneirocom/Magick/blob/development/README.md) for the latest steps on installing and how to clone the repo and run from source.

You will need git and node.js 18+ installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/Oneirocom/Magick
cd Magick
npm install
npm run dev
```

You can run `npm install` as needed, but `npm run dev` will also run install if anything has changed. However, you will need to run `npm install` the first time you download Magick.
