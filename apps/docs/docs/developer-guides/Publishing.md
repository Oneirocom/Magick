# Publishing

Magick contains a set of publishable packages, specifically for the engine and editor. Other applications can integrate the editor or run Magick spells using these libraries.

## Versioning

Magick uses semantic versioning with Lerna. To version, run `npm run version`

## Publishing

To publish a new version of all packages, run `npm run publish`
