# Building Executables

The Magick client is set up with Capacitor and can be built to iOS, Android and desktop with Electron. Currently, the IDE user interface is only designed for desktop apps, however in the future mobile will also be supported.

To build a desktop executable for your platform, run `npm run build-electron`
