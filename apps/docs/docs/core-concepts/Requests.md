# Requests

Most of the large generative models are accessed from external services-- for example, GPT-4 is called from OpenAI's servers. Magick is sending the data to the server as part of a "request".

Requests are tracked in the "Requests" pane of the Magick IDE. All data from the request and response is included, as well as a calculated cost. You can download this data as a CSV file to perform analytics on it.
