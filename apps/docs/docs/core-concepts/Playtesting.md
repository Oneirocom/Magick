# Playtesting

When you're making a spell you're going to want to test it. A lot.

The playtest window lets you send an event to the agent which simulates input from any connector. You can use this to test your spell.

This should all be set up to be easy to use from scratch but you might need to change some of the underlying event data. You can press the "Data" button in the Playtest window to access that.
