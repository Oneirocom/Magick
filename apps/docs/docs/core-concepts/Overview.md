# Core Concepts Overview

Magick is powerful, and you can wield that power immediately by using the spells written by wizards who have come before. But if you want to write your own spells, there's a lot to learn. Magick makes it easier by abstracting a lot of the code and complexity away, but there are still many concepts that you should be aware of.

We are all on this journey together. Nobody has used Magick to it's full potential, not even the grand wizards who made it. There are no rules, no one way to do anything, and this codebase is open for you to change.

The core concepts documented here are quick notes from the wizards to help you grasp the terminology and understand the various parts of Magick before diving in. Please submit a ticket on the Magick repo if you need additional clarity on any topic, or submit a pull request if you'd like to clarify yourself.

Good luck brave adventurer!
