# Build VRM Prototype

**Key Result**: Working demo of VRM character with voice, movement, and basic LLM responses by the end of the month.

1. **Create basic 3D model and animations for character**
    - Develop a simple 3D mesh, rig, and idle animations for the VRM character.
    - **Measurable Result**: Complete 50% of the 3D model and animations within the month of June 2023.

2. **Integrate text-to-speech for voice responses**
    - Connect a text-to-speech engine to the character so it can "speak" responses generated from the LLM.
    - **Measurable Result**: Successfully integrate the text-to-speech engine and have the character speak at least 5 sample phrases within the month of June 2023.

3. **Connect LLM responses to character behavior**
    - Map LLM response texts to relevant character animations, emoting, and voice inflections.
    - Design fallback "neutral" behaviors.
    - **Measurable Result**: Implement LLM connection and map at least 3 different response types to character animations within the month of June 2023.

4. **Recreate the character page in for homework in react three fibre (Personal)**
    - Set up a new React project using create-react-app and install react-three-fiber.
    - Create a basic scene with a camera, lighting, and the VRM character model.
    - Import the character's animations and connect them to user interactions or LLM responses.
    - Measurable Result: Have a working character page with basic interactivity and animations implemented using react-three-fiber within the middle of July 2023.


## Other goals

1. Reliable Connectivity: The bot should consistently connect and respond without any problems, as a seamless connection is crucial for success. 
(maybe some measurement of downtime/uptime? what can we measure? Key Results are measurable with a number or date or something like that to measure against)

2. Smooth Interaction: Make certain that the character interaction is fluid and natural, offering an enjoyable user experience. 
(this is a Objective, not a key result. Its a great objective, but key results have a number or date. What can we MEASURE to validate that the interaction is fluid and natural?)

3. Satisfying User Experience: Most users should have a positive impression of their interactions with the bot, avoiding any unsettling feelings. (90% or more? meaning if we hit 75% its GREAT, but this will require that you actually test with users to get this number validated, can you do that in one month? might need to be next time)
