# Terminology

Laying down a standard terminology for what each component is called throughout the application. 

Currently there's some fuzz that gets in the way of clarity and specificity. (as of 21/02/2023).

> **Graph** vs **Spell**

> What is a single element of a **Graph/Spell** called? A **Node**? A **Leaf**? Blender calls them **Nodes**.

> The **Inputs/Outputs** on the side of an element.
