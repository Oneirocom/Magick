/**
 * @class KeyvStateService
 *
 * The KeyvStateService class implements the IStateService interface and is responsible for
 * managing the state of graph nodes in a graph-based application architecture. This service
 * leverages Keyv as a key-value store with a Redis backend for persistence and scalability.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * - Caching: Utilizes an in-memory cache to enhance performance by minimizing database queries.
 * - State Management: Manages and persists state data for nodes in the graph.
 * - Rehydration: Capable of reconstructing state from persistent storage, useful in scenarios like server restarts.
 * - Syncing: Ensures that the temporary state is synced with the persistent store at the end of an event or cycle.
 *
 * Design Patterns:
 * - Service Pattern: Encapsulates the logic related to state management, offering a clean interface to other components.
 * - Singleton Pattern: Typically instantiated once, providing a single point of interaction with the state management logic.
 * - Event-Driven: Works well with event-driven architectures, reacting to and storing the results of various events.
 *
 * Usage Example:
 * ```
 * const redisConnection = new Redis();
 * const stateService = new KeyvStateService(redisConnection);
 * stateService.init(graph, graphNodes);
 * ```
 *
 * @remarks
 * This service is an essential part of the application's infrastructure layer, abstracting the complexities of state
 * handling and allowing other parts of the application to focus on business logic.
